some routes for origin are automatically deleted at time 28 when sending 50 packets at interval of 1.00s

after path expiration path is not deleted // FOR NOW NOT NEEDED ROUTE IS DELETED SO IT IS FINE IF PATH IS NOT DELETED

multiuple paths still not forming in many cases

Route lifetime functions is working fine but path->SetExpire function is not working neither Updatepathtime but actually 
we dont need that as we have to work on the latest energy and every path nees to be updated after some time

actually path expiratin work if we do the routeUpdate after that

after route expiry from valid , route doesnt get deleted but goed to down/invalid with a time period of 15s.

may have to increase route expiration time as when interval is set to 1s and we have 5 paths then it takes 5s but route expiration time max can be 4.2 s smthng

//a good rerr checking case can be wifi-energy-longRange with interval = 1s as RERR is produced but packet is not received afte that
